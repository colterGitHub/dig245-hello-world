  My name: Colter <br>
  My year: Sophmore <br>
  My major: Environmental or Computer Science <br>
  <br>
  I am taking this course because I have worked with Html and CSS in the past and
  wanted to learn more <br>
  <br>
  In the past, I have created a few small websites for a web design class in high school.
  I have also taken APCS P, APCS A, and Python in high school. Last year I did CS221 Data Structures.
  <br>
  <br>
  My goals for this course are to explore front-end design further and hopefully do well!

  I found this project to be extremely cool. I love listening to and talking about music.
  It was able to come up with quippy responses even for more niche artists that were pretty spot on
