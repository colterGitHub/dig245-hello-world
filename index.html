  My name: Colter <br>
  My year: Sophmore <br>
  My major: Environmental or Computer Science <br>
  <br>
  <h1>#2</h1>

  I am taking this course because I have worked with Html and CSS in the past and
  wanted to learn more <br>
  <br>
  <h1>#3</h1>
  In the past, I have created a few small websites for a web design class in high school.
  I have also taken APCS P, APCS A, and Python in high school. Last year I did CS221 Data Structures.
  <br>
  <br>
  <h1>#4</h1>
  My goals for this course are to explore front-end design further and hopefully do well!

  One ‘learn-computing’ activity I did was all about the command line. I have only had a little bit of experience with command line in the past,
  and I never actually understood what it was doing or used for.
  <br>
  The command line is used as a way to interact with files, folders, and documents on your computer just like you would with a mouse and using
  the graphical user interface. However, there are some things that command line can do that you cannot do with the graphical interface.
  You have the ability to use commands in command lines that will give you information about files on your computer.

  I found this project to be extremely cool. I love listening to and talking about music.
  It was able to come up with quippy responses even for more niche artists that were pretty spot on

  I enjoyed looking at how far out into the universe our radio waves traveled. Its difficult to belive that radiowaves have gone so far!

  <br>
  This website is a fun imaginative story where you wake up as jeff bezos one day and you have to spend all of your money. It gives alot
  of perspective on just how much money Bezos has!

  # I found the most difficult part of the project was writing the learn computing summary because i really dont like writing
